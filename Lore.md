Context
In the year 2037 the WHO discovers a new virus into the Cairo city.
To fight this virus the UN closes all the frontiers between the Cairo and the rest of the world.
But as the time past the WHO notices that there are lots of people breaking the Quarantine. To prevent that, they bring a six floors tall robot called A.H.S (automated health security) wich is controlled by an AI
This vigilance AI who's called B1G_BR0T3R gets the task to eliminate all the infections in the city. But as the developers hadn't give him clear instructions the AI analyzed how to suprime deseases and got up to the conclusion that the only way to destroy them was by killing every single life form in the city.
Soon all the animals and plants were killed by A.H.S who created robots with an autorreplicant technology to kill the people, hacked the security sistem of the city, installed AA defenses to avoid being destroyed and started using solar energy to survive.
After three months there are only 30.000 survivors who had been creating shelters. But there is almost no place safe and no plant to get food. So the only way to survive they got was by stealing food of the supermarket and trying to get to the border.
There are three main organizations
The resistance: they are war veterans and milicians who try to find a way to destroy the machine.
The Tesla squad: they had organised lots of convoys wich uses electric cars to escape the zone and a E-Rally to get food and water.
The last group are the DevOs: while trying to stop B1G_BR0TH3R the UN send a developers and militar squad. They are trying to restore life to survive underground.
The main character of this story is Abdullah who belongs to the resistance and is the leader of a terrorist organisation. As he got trapped inside the city and no ones know about his career on Alqaeda he's trying to destroy the robot to escape.
Story
Abdullah reaches the resistance HQ and join them
As a prove about his loyalty, Abdullah must go alone to steal some food
To prove him last, Abdullah must kill 10 robots wich are messing up
As a new member of the resistance, Abdullah and 3 teammates travel to a gunshop to get some ammu 
Abdullah must go to do an alliance with the other organizations
Abdullah must win a drive in the E-Rally to do an alliance with the Tesla squad
After winning, Abdullah goes with the DevOs which told him that if they reach the terminal inside the WHO office with the blueprints of A.H.S they may help him
Abdullah goes and reaches the terminal, then he gives the data to them
The engineers found a debility but meanwhile the HQ is under attack, so you call the Tesla squad to help you with the defense
The tesla squad reaches and they got the HQ defended
They must move the HQ
They start getting the materials that they need (10 electronic parts, 20 mechanical pieces and the UN activation code)
They do the final attack to the A.H.S
There are two endings
The
If you save the resistance leader, then everyone will die because in fact heÂ´s a robot (you got some clues at the beggining of the story)
If you save the girl wich is suspicious of you, she will catch you after you win and you will be jailed
If you just destroy the A.H.S but forget to disconect him from the internet, he will infect every computer in the world
If you destroy the A.H.S and then you put an explosive charge inside him, you will die but the world will be safe
